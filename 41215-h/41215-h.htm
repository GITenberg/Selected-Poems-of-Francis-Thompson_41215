<h2>A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Francis Thompson</span>, a poet of high thinking, "of celestial vision," and of
imaginings that found literary images of answering splendour, died in
London in the winter of 1907. His life&mdash;always a fragile one&mdash;doubtless
owed its prolongation to "man's unconquerable mind," in him so
invincible through all vicissitude that he seemed to add a new
significance to Wordsworth's phrase. To his mortal frame was denied the
vitality that informs his verse. Howbeit, his verse was himself; he
lived every line of it, fulfilling to the last letter his own
description of the poet, piteous yet proud:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He lives detachèd days;</span>
<span class="i2">He serveth not for praise;</span>
<span class="i4">For gold</span>
<span class="i4">He is not sold.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He asketh not world's eyes;</span>
<span class="i2">Nor to world's ears he cries&mdash;</span>
<span class="i4">Saith, "These</span>
<span class="i4">Shut, if ye please!"</span>
</div></div>

<p>To this aloof moth of a man science was nearly as absorbing an interest
as was the mysticism that some thought had eaten him up; and, to give a
light example of his actuality, he who had scarce handled a bat since he
left Ushaw College,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
knew every famous score of the last quarter of a
century, and left among his papers cricket-verses, trivial yet tragic.
One such verse acquaints us incidentally with his Lancashire lineage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,</span>
<span class="i3">Though my own red roses there may blow;</span>
<span class="i1">It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,</span>
<span class="i3">Though the red roses crest the caps, I know.</span>
<span class="i1">For the field is full of shades as I near the shadowy coast,</span>
<span class="i1">And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,</span>
<span class="i1">And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host</span>
<span class="i3">As the run-stealers flicker to and fro,</span>
<span class="i10">To and fro.</span>
<span class="i3">O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!</span>
</div></div>

<p>Born at Preston in 1859, the son of a doctor afterwards in practice at
Ashton-under-Lyne, he inherited no literary traditions. He had, to be
sure, an uncle, an Oxford convert to Catholicism from the ranks of the
Anglican clergy, whose name appears on the title page of <i>Tracts</i> which,
perhaps because for their own Times, seem assuredly for no other. The
seven years Francis Thompson passed at Ushaw&mdash;a college near Durham,
which then possessed few literary traditions besides those of Lingard,
Waterton and Wiseman, but can now boast Lafcadio Hearn's as well as
Thompson's own&mdash;were, no doubt, influential for him; for a certain
individualism, still lingering in outstanding seats of learning, gave
him a lucky freedom to follow his own bent&mdash;the ample reading of the
classics. After Ushaw he went to Owens College, to qualify for his
father's profession; in his preliminary examination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
distinguishing himself in Greek. His attempts to translate dead language into living
dated back to these days; though of the list of words, which some who
were amused and others who were irritated put down to his own inventing,
many were made familiar to him in his intercourse with Milton, with
Shelley, with Shakspere&mdash;his most vital companions. If these poets went,
like Alexander, as far as Chaos, and if Thompson hazarded one step more,
as Emerson said Goethe did, Thompson too swung himself safely back
again. In Manchester, Literature, if not Melancholy, had already marked
him for her own; and it was his <i>Religio Medici</i> rather than his
<i>Materia Medica</i> that he put under his pillow, perhaps the lump of it
suggesting to him his after image about the poet's dreaming:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">The hardest pang whereon</span>
<span class="i1">He lays his mutinous head may be a Jacob's stone.</span>
</div></div>

<p>A definite reminiscence of the dissecting-room at Manchester may
certainly be discovered in his allusion (in <i>An Anthem of Earth</i>) to the
heart as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5"><i>Arras'd in purple</i> like the house of kings,</span>
<span class="i1">the regal heart that comes at last</span>
<span class="i5">To stall the grey rat, and the carrion-worm</span>
<span class="i10">Statelily lodge.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Possibly the sorrow of filial duty unperformed&mdash;a sorrow deeper with him
than is common among such predestined delinquents&mdash;aggravated the bodily
ailments which already beset him; and drastic indeed were the remedies
he himself prescribed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
"Physician, heal thyself": the dire taunt took
flesh, as it were, in Francis Thompson, and his plight was visible to
all men. Himself he could not save. Biography strangely repeats itself,
not in common mental experience only, but also in uncovenanted details
of fact and incident. Like De Quincey, whose writings he took into his
blood, Thompson had a nervous illness in Manchester; like De Quincey he
went to London, and knew Oxford Street for a stony-hearted stepmother;
his wealth, like De Quincey's once, lay in two volumes, for he carried
Æschylus in one pocket, Blake in the other; and the parallel might, if
to profit, be further outdrawn.</p>

<p>To most incongruous modes of making a living he now put his hand. His
assistantship in a shop near Leicester Square would have fitted him for
the production of a record of <i>Adventures among Boots</i>; and later, as a
"collector" for a book-seller he must often have bent beneath the sack,
which, if heavy, so he might comfort himself, was at least heavy with
books. Of these things he spoke with a matter-of-fact, all-accepting,
simplicity when, a little later, some verses he sent to a magazine
brought him believers, who sought until they found him. After a course
of medical treatment, he went to Storrington. That beautiful Sussex
village has now its fixed place on the map of English literature. For
there it was that Francis Thompson discovered his possibilities as a
poet. On its common he met the village child, whom he calls "Daisy," in
the verses that are so named.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
And it was characteristic of this poet
that from the ordinary episodes of ordinary days he made his "golden
musics." When he saw the sunset at Storrington, the resulting Ode was
dotted with local landmarks&mdash;the cross, for instance, casting its shadow
in the monastery garden. The children of the family in London, into
which he was received, were the subjects of <i>Poppy</i>, <i>The Making of
Viola</i>, <i>To Monica Thought Dying</i>, <i>To my Godchild</i>&mdash;all in the first
book of <i>Poems</i>; while two of their number have a noble heritage in
<i>Sister Songs</i>. Constant to the end, when he died some newly pencilled
lines were found, addressed "To Olivia," a yet younger sister, recalling
the strains of fifteen years before:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">I fear to love you, Sweet, because</span>
<span class="i1">Love's the ambassador of loss.</span>
</div></div>

<p>To their mother likewise were addressed the poems of Fair Love, labelled
<i>Love in Dian's Lap</i>, of which Coventry Patmore said that "Laura might
have been proud"; hers also were many of the <i>New Poems</i>.</p>

<p>If, therefore, as one critic after another declared, a poet had dropped
from the skies&mdash;those skies of light&mdash;of the Seventeenth Century, he
dropped very much upon the spot. "Mr Thompson must simply be Crashaw
born again, but born greater," declared the first of his reviewers; and
Mr Traill, in <i>The Nineteenth Century</i>, inquired: "Where, unless perhaps
here and there in a sonnet of Rossetti's, has this sort of sublimated enthusiasm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
for the bodily and spiritual beauty of womanhood found such
expression between the age of the Stuarts and our own?" Mr Traill added
boldly his belief&mdash;daring then, though acceptable enough now&mdash;that
"alike in wealth and dignity of imagination, in depth and subtlety of
thought and in magic and mastery of language," England possessed in this
little volume the evidence of "a new poet of the first rank." More
expectedly, Coventry Patmore, in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>, hailed in the
new-comer a disciple of their common master, the Florentine Poet of Fair
Love, and expressed the opinion that "Mr Thompson's qualities ought to
place him in the permanent ranks of fame." The <i>Hound of Heaven</i> was to
Patmore "one of the very few <i>great</i> odes of which the language can
boast."</p>

<p>Such pronouncements proved at least that a poet, who had no friend save
such as his published poems gained for him, could count on an immediate
recognition for high merit. For these tributes, and many more of like
welcoming, placed him instantly out of range of the common casualties of
criticism. And he had what poets of old to their great sorrow lacked; he
had trial by his peers; a kind fate gave him fellow poets among his
reviewers.</p>

<p>Perhaps a more convincing sign even than that of professional praise was
conveyed by the chance allusion he lighted on later in Lady
Burne-Jones's biography of her husband: "The winter's labour," she says,
"was cheered by the appearance of a small volume of poems by an author
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
whose name (Francis Thompson) was till then unknown to us. The little
book moved him to admiration and hope." And, speaking of <i>The Hound of
Heaven</i>, Burne-Jones himself said: "Since Gabriel's 'Blessed Damozel' no
mystical words have so touched me. Shall I ever forget how I undressed
and dressed again, and had to undress again&mdash;a thing I most
hate&mdash;because I could think of nothing else?"</p>

<p><i>Sister Songs</i>, published in 1895&mdash;the poem of which Mr William Archer
has said that "Shelley would have adored it"&mdash;is a poem to read aloud;
for sound and sense herein celebrate their divine nuptials. One of the
high memories of the present writer is that of hearing it so read by Mr
George Wyndham at the hearthstone of Byron's granddaughter. The lines
therein that deal with sex, dormant in the child-girl, yielded the poet
perhaps his most amazing imagery. "Superabundance," murmured
some&mdash;surely a "fault" as happy as was ever son of Adam's. The charge of
obscurity brought against the poem was more apt; for who that did not
know of his days&mdash;and his nights&mdash;in the London streets, could follow
such a poignant piece of autobiography as this?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Forlorn, and faint, and stark,</span>
<span class="i0">I had endured through watches of the dark</span>
<span class="i2">The abashless inquisition of each star;</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, was the outcast mark</span>
<span class="i8">Of all those heavenly passers' scrutiny;</span>
<span class="i8">Stood bound and helplessly</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For Time to shoot his barbèd minutes at me;</span>
<span class="i0">Suffered the trampling hoof of every hour</span>
<span class="i6">In night's slow-wheelèd car;</span>
<span class="i2">Until the tardy dawn dragged me at length</span>
<span class="i2">From under those dread wheels; and, bled of strength,</span>
<span class="i4">I waited the inevitable last.</span>
<span class="i6">Then there came past</span>
<span class="i0">A child; like thee, a spring-flower; but a flower</span>
<span class="i0">Fallen from the budded coronal of Spring,</span>
<span class="i0">And through the city-streets blown withering.</span>
<span class="i0">She passed,&mdash;O brave, sad, lovingest, tender thing!&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">And of her own scant pittance did she give,</span>
<span class="i8">That I might eat and live:</span>
<span class="i0">Then fled, a swift and trackless fugitive.</span>
</div></div>

<p>And how shall that final episode be turned more explicitly? There are
still a few things left that cannot be uttered, or, if uttered, that
become the counterpart, even for the willing ear, of that "tenuity of
the bat's cry" reported to elude the common hearing. It is even as
Balzac, great talker himself, says, that everything (especially theology
I think) is the cheaper for being discussed. Yet this untold story
transcends the mere romance of De Quincey's Ann, and might, indeed, for
a moment, reverse Rossetti's just indictment of the life of "Jenny"&mdash;"It
makes a goblin of the sun." For this "flower fallen from the budded
coronal of Spring" took root and flourished, even in London mire, and
again the fragrant petals unfolded and the greenery grew.</p>

<p>In <i>New Poems</i> Francis Thompson put forth in <i>The Mistress of Vision</i>
his stark gospel of renunciation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>.
It is the last word of an asceticism
which he practised as well as preached&mdash;most strait in its abnegation of
everything but the beauty his verse, unlike his life, never could
renounce. Coventry Patmore, Thompson's true "Captain of Song," used to
say that the young poet's prose was even finer than his poetry, and his
talk better than both. This was a statement with the true Patmorean
touch of paradox. Any way, the talk had no reporter, and of his
prose&mdash;his "heroic prose," as it has been called&mdash;only one example
passed, during his life, into book form&mdash;the complaint made by Brother
Ass, the Body, against its rider, the Soul. This was published under the
title of <i>Health and Holiness</i>, accompanied by a Note from Father
Tyrrell. But his experiences in prose, as a reviewer, were wide as his
sympathies, and these were sanely universal. His articles in <i>The
Academy</i>, under Mr Lewis Hind's editorship, must choke up many a
scrapbook. Later, his contributions to <i>The Athenæum</i> afforded him his
greatest scope and stimulant; and only with his death came the eclipse
of his powers. Editors forbore to be angry at his delays, for, after a
while of waiting, they got from him, at last, what none else could give
at all.</p>

<p>About ten weeks before the darkness fell on him the little flame of his
life began visibly to flicker. A change to the country was advised; and
he became the carefully tended guest of Mr Wilfrid Blunt&mdash;not many miles
from the Storrington of his early love, to which, however, not wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
arabs could any longer draw him. He was too weak for any travel, save
that which brought him back to London&mdash;better, he himself said, but
surely dying, as it seemed to solicitous eyes.</p>

<p>
Ten days before his death he went as a private
patient to the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth,
in St John's Wood, and there, at the age of
forty-eight, on November 13, 1907, he passed
away at dawn&mdash;the dawn that was the death-hour
in his <i>Dream Tryst</i>. He was laid to rest in St
Mary's Cemetery, Kensal Green. In his coffin were
roses from the garden of Mr George Meredith,
inscribed with Mr Meredith's testimony, "A true
poet, one of the small band"; and violets from
kindred turf went to the dead poet's breast from
the hand of her whose praises he had divinely
sung. Devoted friends lament him, no less for himself
than for his singing. He made all men his<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">debtors, leaving to those who loved him the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">memory of a unique personality, and</span><br />

<h4>THE HOUND OF HEAVEN</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">I fled Him, down the nights and down the days;</span>
<span class="i2">I fled Him down the arches of the years;</span>
<span class="i1">I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways</span>
<span class="i2">Of my own mind; and in the mist of tears</span>
<span class="i1">I hid from Him, and under running laughter.</span>
<span class="i6">Up vistaed hopes I sped;</span>
<span class="i6">And shot, precipitated,</span>
<span class="i1">Adown Titanic glooms of chasmèd fears,</span>
<span class="i2">From those strong Feet that followed, followed after.</span>
<span class="i7">But with unhurrying chase,</span>
<span class="i7">And unperturbèd pace,</span>
<span class="i3">Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,</span>
<span class="i7">They beat&mdash;and a Voice beat</span>

<span class="i3">"All things betray thee, who betrayest Me."</span>

<span class="i2">The gust of His approach would clash it to.</span>
<span class="i1">Fear wist not to evade, as Love wist to pursue.</span>
<span class="i1">Across the margent of the world I fled,</span>
<span class="i2">And troubled the gold gateways of the stars,</span>
<span class="i2">Smiting for shelter on their clangèd bars;</span>
<span class="i7">Fretted to dulcet jars</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<span class="i1">And silvern chatter the pale ports o' the moon.</span>
<span class="i1">I said to dawn, Be sudden; to eve, Be soon;</span>
<span class="i2">With thy young skiey blossoms heap me over</span>
<span class="i7">From this tremendous Lover!</span>
<span class="i1">Float thy vague veil about me, lest He see!</span>
<span class="i2">I tempted all His servitors, but to find</span>
<span class="i1">My own betrayal in their constancy,</span>

<span class="i7">Or whether, Thunder-driven,</span>
<span class="i4">They clanged his chariot 'thwart a heaven</span>
<span class="i1">Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn o' their feet:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.</span>
<span class="i7">Still with unhurrying chase,</span>
<span class="i7">And unperturbèd pace,</span>
<span class="i3">Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,</span>
<span class="i7">Came on the following Feet,</span>
<span class="i7">And a Voice above their beat&mdash;</span>
<span class="i3">"Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">I sought no more that after which I strayed</span>
<span class="i4">In face of man or maid;</span>
<span class="i1">But still within the little children's eyes</span>
<span class="i4">Seems something, something that replies;</span>
<span class="i1"><i>They</i> at least are for me, surely for me!</span>

<span class="i4">With dawning answers there,</span>
<span class="i1">Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.</span>
<span class="i1">"Come then, ye other children, Nature's&mdash;share</span>
<span class="i1">With me" (said I) "your delicate fellowship;</span>
<span class="i4">Let me greet you lip to lip,</span>
<span class="i4">Let me twine with you caresses,</span>

<span class="i7">My thirsting mouth.</span>

<h2><i>Appreciations of Francis Thompson</i></h2>

<p class="blockquot"><i>"Such pronouncements proved at least that a poet, who had no
friend save such as his published poems gained for him, could count
on an immediate recognition for high merit. For these tributes, and
many more of like welcoming, placed him instantly out of range of
the common casualties of criticism."&mdash;From the</i> "<span class="smcap">Note on Francis
Thompson</span>" (p. xii). <i>As the writer of the "Note" has not attempted
a critical estimate of the poetry, some of these Appreciations,
forming a part of the poet's life-history and even of the literary
history of his time, are here reproduced.</i> </p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Francis Thompson</span> is a writer whom it is impossible that any qualified
judge should deny to be a "new poet." And while most poets of his
quality have usually to wait a quarter of a century or more for adequate
recognition, this poet is pretty sure of a wide and immediate
acknowledgement.... We find that in these poems profound thought,
far-fetched splendour of imagery, and nimble-witted discernment of those
analogies which are the roots of the poet's language, abound ...
qualities which ought to place him in the permanent ranks of fame, with
<span class="smcap">Cowley</span> and with <span class="smcap">Crashaw</span>.... <i>The Hound of Heaven</i> has so great and
passionate and such a metre-creating motive, that we are carried over
all obstructions of the rhythmical current, and are compelled to
pronounce it, at the end, one of the very few "great" odes of which the
language can boast. In a lesser degree this metre-making passion
prevails in the seven remarkable pieces called <i>Love in Dian's Lap</i>,
poems of which <span class="smcap">Laura</span> might have been proud, and <span class="smcap">Lucretia</span> not ashamed, to
have had addressed to her. The main region of <span class="smcap">Mr Thompson's</span> poetry is
the inexhaustible and hitherto almost unworked mine of Catholic
philosophy. Not but that he knows better than to make his religion the
direct subject of any of his poems, unless it presents itself to him as
a human passion, and the most human of passions, as it does in the
splendid ode just noticed, in which God's long pursuit and final
conquest of the resisting soul is described in a torrent of as humanly
impressive verse as was ever inspired by a natural affection. <span class="smcap">Mr
Thompson</span> places himself, by these poems, in the front rank of the
pioneers of the movement which, if it be not checked, as in the history
of the world it has once or twice been checked before, by premature
formulation and by popular and profane perversion, must end in creating
a "new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
heaven and a new earth."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Coventry Patmore</span>, in <i>The Fortnightly
Review.</i></p>


<p>It is not only the religious ecstasy of <span class="smcap">Crashaw</span> that they recall; for
all the daringly fantastic imagery, all the love-lyrical hyperbole, all
that strange mixture and artifice, of spontaneous passion and studied
conceit, which were so characteristic of the age of <span class="smcap">Crashaw</span>, are with
the same astonishing fidelity reproduced. Where, unless, perhaps, in
here and there a sonnet of <span class="smcap">Rossetti's</span>, has this sort of sublimated
enthusiasm for the bodily and spiritual beauty of womanhood found such
expression as in <i>Love in Dian's Lap</i> between the age of the Stuarts and
our own? To realize the full extent to which the religious, or
semi-religious, emotions&mdash;now ecstatic, now awe-stricken&mdash;dominate and
colour the entire fabric of these strange poems, they must be read
throughout. In the lines <i>To the Dead Cardinal of Westminster</i> we see
them at their subtlest; and in the very powerful piece, <i>The Hound of
Heaven</i>&mdash;a poem setting forth the pursuit of the human soul by divine
grace&mdash;they are at their most intense.... That minority who can
recognize the essentials under the accidents of poetry, and who feel
that it is to poetic Form alone, and not to forms, that eternity
belongs, will agree that, alike in wealth and dignity of imagination, in
depth and subtlety of thought, and in magic and mastery of language, a
new poet of the first rank is to be welcomed in the author of this
volume.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. D. Traill</span>, in <i>The Nineteenth Century</i>.</p>


<p>The first thing to be done, and by far the most important, is to
recognize that we are here face to face with a poet of the first order,
a man of imagination all compact, a seer and singer of rare genius. He
revels indeed in "orgiac imageries," and revelry implies excess. But
when excess is an excess of strength, the debauch a debauch of beauty,
who can condemn or even regret it? Would we had a few more poets who
could exceed in such imagery as this! It is no minor Caroline singer he
recalls, but the Jacobean <span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>.&mdash;<i>The Daily Chronicle.</i></p>


<p>A volume of poetry has not appeared in <span class="smcap">Queen Victoria's</span> reign more
authentic in greatness of utterance than this. In the rich and virile
harmonies of his line, in strange and lovely vision, in fundamental
meaning, he is possibly the first of Victorian poets, and at least is he
of none the inferior.... In all sobriety do we believe him of all poets
to be the most celestial in vision, the most august in faculty.... In a
word, a new planet has swum into the ken of the watchers of the poetic
skies. These are big words;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
but we have weighed them. For there is that
in Mr <span class="smcap">Francis Thompson's</span> poetry which discourages the flamboyant
appreciations of the more facile impressionist, and gives him pause in
his ready-made enthusiasms. It is patent on the first page that there is
genius in this inspiration, and the great note in this utterance; but
page after page reveals the rich and the strange, and the richer and the
stranger in so many original moods and noble measures, that the reviewer
feels the necessity of caution.... In nothing does <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> appear more
authentically a poet than in the fact that his sense of beauty is part
of his religion. In this he is like <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>, except that <span class="smcap">Shelley's</span> sense
of beauty was his religion, and lived in an atmosphere of sensuousness,
a sensuousness that has little of the grosser taints of earth about it
indeed, but which is still sensuousness. Therefore, <span class="smcap">Shelley</span> wrote the
glorious <i>Epipsychidion</i>; therefore, Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> writes <i>Her Portrait</i>,
the longest and greatest poem in his book; and, speaking for ourselves,
we shall say at once that <i>Epipsychidion</i>, long unique in the language,
has at last found its parallel, perhaps its peer, in <i>Her Portrait</i>. Of
this "Her" of Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson's</span> we must say that she is the significance of
his book. If his sense of beauty is part of his religion, his religion
is that of a rapt Catholic, to whom the very heaven, with all that
therein be, is open and palpable; his is the Catholicism of profound
mysticism, and of the most universal temper.... It is perfectly safe to
affirm that if Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> write no other line, by this volume alone he
is as secure of remembrance as any poet of the century. His vocabulary
is very great.... Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson's</span> first volume is no mere promise&mdash;it is
itself among the great achievements of English poetry; it has reached
the peak of Parnassus at a bound.</p>

<p>He has actually accomplished the high thing in metaphysical poetry that
<span class="smcap">Donne</span> and <span class="smcap">Crashaw</span> only dreamed of. His mysticism is infinitely more
profound and significant than theirs, as his imagination is more
impulsive, ardent, and beautiful. He is the great Platonist of English
poetry. If Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> had never written anything after his first
volume, there would be but one Stuart poet with whom the author of <i>Her
Portrait</i> could be compared for orchestral majesties of song, and that
one <span class="smcap">Milton</span>.... He is an argonaut of literature, far travelled in the
realms of gold, and he has in a strange degree the assimilative mind....
We do not think we forget any of the splendid things of an English
anthology when we say that <i>The Hound of Heaven</i> seems to us, on the
whole, the most wonderful lyric in the language. It fingers all the
stops of the spirit, and we hear now a thrilling and dolorous note of
doom, and now the quiring of the spheres, and now the very pipes of
Pan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
but under all the still, sad music of humanity. It is the return
of the nineteenth century to <span class="smcap">Thomas a Kempis</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. L. Garvin</span>, in <i>The
Newcastle Chronicle</i> and in <i>The Bookman</i>.</p>


<p>The fine frenzy, and the fine line: these are two root characteristics
of Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson's</span> really remarkable poem. One has seldom seen poet more
wildly abandoned to his rapture, more absorbed in the trance of his
ecstasy. When the irresistible moment comes, he throws himself upon his
mood as a glad swimmer gives himself to the waves, careless whither the
strong tide carries him, knowing only the wild joy of the laughing
waters and the rainbow spray. He shouts, as it were, for mere gladness,
in the welter of wonderful words, and he dives swift and fearless to
fetch his deep-sea fancies. When weak men venture on these vagaries they
drown; but Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> is a strong swimmer. Hyperboles, which in other
hands had seemed merely absurd, in his delight us as examples of that
"fine excess" which is one of the most enthralling of the many
enchantments of poetry.... Indeed, Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> must simply be <span class="smcap">Crashaw</span>
born again, but born greater. Though the conception, for example, of
<i>The Hound of Heaven</i>&mdash;the case of a sinner fleeing from the love of
Christ&mdash;is exactly in <span class="smcap">Crashaw's</span> vein, yet it was not in his power to
have suggested such tremendous speed and terror of flight as whirls
through every line of Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson's</span> poem.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. Le Gallienne</span>, in <i>The
Daily Chronicle</i>.</p>


<p>A new poet&mdash;and this time a major and not a minor one. On the section
called <i>Love in Dian's Lap</i>, much might be said of its extraordinary
conception and workmanship. The section is one long, beautiful song of
praise, and even worship, of one whom the poet calls his "dear
administress." But surely never was woman worshipped with more utter
chastity of passion. Whether <i>Before her Portrait in Youth</i>, or
regarding her as <i>A poet breaking silence</i>, or only reflecting on her
wearing of a new dress, the Poet is so full of fine matter and so
adoring in his expression of it, as to bring <span class="smcap">Dante</span> himself to
mind.&mdash;<i>St. James's Gazette.</i></p>


<p>Here are dominion&mdash;domination over language, and a sincerity as of
Robert Burns.... The epithet sublime has been sadly stained and
distorted by comic writers, and there is a danger in applying it in its
honest light without warning. This safeguard established, we have to say
that in our opinion Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson's</span> poetry at its highest attains a
sublimity unsurpassed by any Victorian poet&mdash;a sublimity which will
stand the hideous test of extracts. In <i>Her Portrait</i> a constant
interchange of symbol between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
earthly and heavenly beauty pulses like
day and night.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Davidson</span>, in <i>The Speaker</i>.</p>


<p>When at the end of 1893 there appeared a little quarto volume of poems
by <span class="smcap">Francis Thompson</span>, the English world of letters experienced an
agreeable shock of surprise. It was as if a rocket had been sent up into
a dark night. His poems have all the "pomp and prodigality" of
imagination for which Gray's frugal muse longed.&mdash;<i>The Spectator.</i></p>


<p>Words and cadences must have had an intoxication for him, the
intoxication of the scholar; and "cloudy trophies" were continually
falling into his hands, and half through them, in his hurry to seize and
brandish them. He swung a rare incense in a censer of gold, under the
vault of a chapel where he had hung votive offerings. When he chanted in
his chapel of dreams, the airs were often airs which he had learnt from
<span class="smcap">Crashaw</span> and from <span class="smcap">Patmore</span>. They came to life again when he used them, and
he made for himself a music which was part strangely familiar and part
his own, almost bewilderingly. Such reed-notes and such orchestration of
sound were heard nowhere else; and people listened to the music,
entranced as by a new magic. The genius of <span class="smcap">Francis Thompson</span> was
Oriental, exuberant in colour, woven into elaborate patterns, and went
draped in old silk robes, that had survived many dynasties. The
spectacle of him was an enchantment; he passed like a wild vagabond of
the mind, dazzling our sight. He had no message, but he dropt sentences
by the way, cries of joy or pity, love of children, worship of the
Virgin and the Saints, and of those who were patron saints to him on
earth; his voice was heard like a wandering music, which no one heeded
for what it said, in a strange tongue, but which came troublingly into
the mind, bringing it the solace of its old, recaptured
melodies.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arthur Symons</span>, in <i>The Saturday Review</i>.</p>


<p>To read Mr <span class="smcap">Francis Thompson's</span> <i>Poems</i>, then, is like setting sail with
<span class="smcap">Drake</span> or <span class="smcap">Hawkins</span> in search of new worlds and golden spoils. He has the
magnificent Elizabethan manner, the splendour of conception, the
largeness of imagery.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Katherine Tynan-Hinkson</span>, in <i>The Bookman</i>.</p>


<p>As a matter of fact&mdash;such fact as one kisses the book to in a court of
law&mdash;it was in a railway carriage on my way back to London that I first
read Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson's</span> poem, <i>The Mistress of Vision</i>; but, in such truth as
would pass anywhere but in a court of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
law, it was at Cambridge, in the
height of the summer term and in a Fellows' Garden that the revelation
first came. I thought then in my enthusiasm that no such poem had been
written or attempted since <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> attempted, and left off writing,
<i>Kubla Khan</i>. In a cooler hour I think so yet; and, were my age
twenty-five or so, it would delight me to swear to it, riding to any
man's drawbridge who shuts his gates against it, and blowing the horn of
challenge. It is verily a wonderful poem; hung, like a fairy tale, in
middle air&mdash;a sleeping palace of beauty set in a glade in the heart of
the woods of Westermain, surprised there and recognized with a gasp as
satisfying, and summarizing a thousand youthful longings after beauty.
To me also my admiration seemed too hot to last; but four or five years
leave me unrepentant. It seemed to me to be more likely to be a
perishable joy, because I had once clutched at, and seemed to grasp,
similar beauties in <span class="smcap">Poe</span>. Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson's</span> thought, always strong, often
runs into phrases of exquisite sweetness and exquisite clarity.... The
lines beginning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Firm is the man, and set beyond the cast</span>
<span class="i1">Of fortune's game and the iniquitous hour,"</span>
</div></div>

<p>are worthy to be remembered beside <span class="smcap">Daniel's</span> <i>Epistle to the Countess of
Cumberland</i>.&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">A. Quiller Couch</span> ("Q"), in <i>The Daily News</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Thompson's</span> poetry is a "wassail of orgiac imageries." He is a poet's
poet, like <span class="smcap">Shelley</span> and <span class="smcap">Blake</span>. In order to follow him as he soars from
image to image and symbol to symbol, you must have the rare wings of
imagination.... <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> mixes his metaphors so wisely that they
illumine each other, strange light shooting out of their weltering
chaos, like the radiance of phosphorescent waves. He troubles you with
sudden pictures that flash out against the blackness. This gift of
dreadful vision is not found in <span class="smcap">Crashaw</span> or in <span class="smcap">Patmore</span>, in <span class="smcap">Donne</span> or in
<span class="smcap">Herbert</span>, and therefore it seems to me that <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> is essentially more
akin to <span class="smcap">Blake</span>, <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> and <span class="smcap">Rossetti</span> than to the ecclesiastical
mystics. He is a twentieth-century mystic with a seventeenth-century
manner.&mdash;<span class="smcap">James Douglas</span>, in <i>The Morning Leader</i>.</p>


<p>Great poets are obscure for two opposite reasons; now, because they are
talking about something too large for anyone to understand, and now,
again, because they are talking about something too small for anyone to
see. <span class="smcap">Francis Thompson</span> possessed both these infinities.... He was
describing the evening earth with its mist and fume and fragrance, and
represented the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
whole as rolling upwards like a smoke; then suddenly he
called the whole ball of the earth a thurible, and said that some
gigantic spirit swung it slowly before God. This is the case of the
image too large for comprehension; another instance sticks in my mind of
the image which is too small. In one of his poems he says that the abyss
between the known and the unknown is bridged by "Pontifical death."
There are about ten historical and theological puns in that one word.
That a priest means a pontiff, that a pontiff means a bridge-maker, that
death is certainly a bridge, that death may turn out after all to be a
reconciling priest, that at least priest and bridges both attest to the
fact that one thing can get separated from another thing&mdash;these ideas,
and twenty more, are all tacitly concentrated in the word "Pontifical."
In <span class="smcap">Francis Thompson's</span> poetry, as in the poetry of the universe, you can
work infinitely out and out, but yet infinitely in and in. These two
infinities are the mark of greatness; and he was a great poet.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. K.
Chesterton</span>, in <i>The Illustrated London News</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Thompson</span> used his large vocabulary with a boldness&mdash;and especially a
recklessness, almost a frivolity in rhyme&mdash;that were worthy of <span class="smcap">Browning</span>.
On the other hand, these rugged points were, at a further view, absorbed
into the total effect of beauty in a manner which <span class="smcap">Browning</span> never
achieved; for the poet, entirely free from timidity in matters of poetic
form, relied not on chastity or perfection of detail, but on the
perfervid rush of his genius, which simply carried his readers over the
rough places. Here was a large utterance&mdash;large in bulk, in speed, in a
lavish disregard of economy, and yet, what could not for a moment be
mistaken was that the poetry was at once great and sincere. These
<i>Sister Songs</i>, written in praise of two little sisters, contain a
number of lovely and most musical lines, and some passages&mdash;such as the
seventh section of the first poem&mdash;which <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> would not have
disowned.&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>


<p>The greater a poet's message, the more profound his thought, the larger
his range, and the more exquisite his note, the deeper and more
incessant will be his demand upon his reader. That is why the great
poets have had to wait for their recognition. Only the few will or can
co-operate at the beginning, but they are the leaven; and now whole
masses can see the poetic purport of <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>, <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span>, <span class="smcap">Keats</span> and
<span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>, of whom the contemporary criticism was a thing over which
you laugh or cry, as the mood has you. Those who see in Mr <span class="smcap">Francis
Thompson</span> an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
authentic poet have at any rate the profound interest of
watching the various stages in the making of their immortal. How have
the portents followed the precedent afforded by the poets just named? In
general, very accurately, we think. The common attitude of critics
towards them and him has been very similar&mdash;in the case of <span class="smcap">Shelley</span> it is
so near in its very wording as to be sometimes startling. Extravagances
and novelties of diction, a toppling over of images, and "obscurity"&mdash;of
course that&mdash;were dwelt upon by objectors&mdash;very just objectors, no
doubt&mdash;who busied and troubled about details, lost all sense of
proportion, and had no ear for the great and ultimate meaning of the
poet's message.... The note that comes most majestically from Mr
<span class="smcap">Thompson</span> is that of the reconciliation of the two natures and destinies
of man. To that literal oneness <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span> groped in his merely "kindred
points of heaven and home." Of that oneness <span class="smcap">Rossetti</span> has the hint, and
<span class="smcap">Coventry Patmore</span> the full vision. Mr <span class="smcap">Thompson</span> is the heir of the poets,
and he has entered fully into his inheritance. He has not picked their
flowers and worn them fading; their seed has passed into his life, and
they have blossomed anew.&mdash;<i>The Academy.</i></p>


<p>No other among the younger poets so effectually proclaimed a mastery of
the grand style: none other had so securely occupied a position on the
right side of the line which for ever separates inspiration from talent,
poetry from agreeable verse. He appeared on the scene fully equipped.
There were no long years of public neglect, or production of volumes
which lay unnoticed on the bookstalls before being cast into the dust
heap. The marvellous splendour of his first volume revealed a writer of
no common order; with a secureness of touch, a magical decoration of
style, and a real message behind all the pomp and glitter and dazzling
display. It was art not for art's sake, but charged with a meaning and a
name. <i>The Hound of Heaven</i> was hailed by all competent critics as one
of the great religious poems of this time or of any time.&mdash;<i>The Daily
News.</i></p>

Thompson might yet have worked upon to remove, here a defective rhyme,
there an unexpected elision. But no altered mind would he have brought
to its main purport; and the prevision of "Heaven in Earth and God in
Man," pervading his earlier published verse, we find here accented by
poignantly local and personal allusions. For in these triumphing
stanzas, he held in retrospect those days and nights of human
dereliction he spent beside London's River, and in the shadow&mdash;but all
radiance to him&mdash;of Charing Cross.</p></div>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
